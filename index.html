    <p>George Washington Carver’s work, which began for the sake of poor Black sharecroppers, led to a better life for
      the entire South by liberating it from its environmentally destructive dependence on cotton. His efforts brought
      about a significant advance in agricultural training in an era when agriculture was the largest single occupation
      of Americans.</p>
